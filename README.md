Ex1a.csv does not have any change in original label.
If we run the code with Ex_1A.ipynb, we will get ~87% accuracy(just intrduced a new feature)
Ex2a.csv I have introuduced new anomalies @200, 400, by changing the levels as they have shap jum. So if we run my code Ex_1A.ipynb, with this data set you will get ~97% training accuracy and 99% test accuracy.
